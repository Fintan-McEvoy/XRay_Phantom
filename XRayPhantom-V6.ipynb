Increasing the size of the electron cloud increases the overall tube current (electrical current passing from cathode to anode) when the exposure switch is closed. Adjusting the kVp changes the electrical potential difference across the x-ray tube (i.e. between the cathode and anode). Changes in mA and in exposure time (s) only affect the number of x-ray photons in the beam (quantitative effect).

    "When a radiographic exposure is made, x-ray photons from the beam interact with the patient.  The organs and tissues within the patient stop some of these photons.  They attenuate the beam.  This property of tissue and organs to attenuate the x-ray beam is described by a parameter called the linear attenuation coefficient, $\\mu$ for the tissue.  Each tissue has a different attenuation coefficient. If the difference between two tissues is sufficiently large, the tissues will contrast with each other, i.e. will appear as a difference shade of gray on the radiograph.\n",

    "You might be able to explain why uniform material might not appear uniform in the image.  The reason is that the energy of the photons that interact with a specific location in tissue (or phantom) is a matter of statistical chance. The x-ray beam is polychromatic (has photons of multiple energies) and the $\\mu$ for a uniform tissue will differ across locations if different locations interact with photons of differing energy.  If the number of photons interacting with each tissue location is low, the chances of overall photon energy differences are high. Remember the photon may come from any region of the spectrum.  If large numbers of photons are used, the statistical chance of an overall difference in the total of photon energies between locations is reduced. The function \"phantom\" uses a Monte Carlo simulation to model this statistical effect seen in real radiographs.   \n",

    "<b>Mean pixel value:</b> There are 100 (10x10) pixels in each of the three squares.  The mean pixel value is the sum of all pixel values in the square divided by 100.  The greater the value, the darker the shade of gray. This is similar to most radiographic displays, the more photons that strike the detector, the darker the region is displayed.\n",

    "<b>SNR:</b> This stands for signal to noise ratio. Signal gives information about the patient, noise is random variation; its presence makes it harder to detect signal in the image.  Higher values of SNR are better than lower.</b>\n",

    "<b>Fat to liver contrast:</b> This is a measure of the difference as it appears to the human observer between the gray tone of the fat and that of liver.  Higher contrast values between two tissues or between diseased and non-disease regions of tissue make those tissues easier to recognize and disease easier to detect.\n",
